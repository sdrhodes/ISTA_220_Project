## Project video writeup

### Introduction and talking about myself

Hello,

I'm Steven Rhodes. I'm a member of the 42d Medical Support Squadron, located at Maxwell AFB. I discovered the MSSA program here at Ft Benning after reading a base bulletin that came across my desk.

At the time, last November, I was still determining the best use of my time during the last months of my enlistment. My shop was overmanned, and there wouldn't be much work for me to do. Having already been accepted in a computer science program in August 2018, I decided I could treat the MSSA program as a coding boot camp to give me an advantage at school. Upon discovering the opportunities and hearing of positions graduates were receiving, I decided to keep my options open.

Now that I've started applying what I'm learning to exercises, I'm thoroughly enjoying the process of coding. What better feeling is there than having a project successfully compile and run after spending hours working through program logic?

### Discussing the project

The project I'd like to speak about is an inventory system. This type of system has been in use in video games for over 30 years. Players will assume the role of a playable character, and that character will have gear, or equipment they can use. The inventory system is how the player interacts with and manages these inventory assets. The players might assume control of a character with starting gear. Or perhaps the character starts with no items, and must pick them up as they progress through the game.

When characters acquire new items, the player has the option of storing them in available inventory space (typically a bag, or backpack). The player could also choose to equip the item on their character if it is wearable. Items may have stats, or values, that have some significance in game. The stats might affect a characters strength, durability, power, etc. Good inventory systems will display this information to the player, so they can make decisions regarding items.

### Overview of what the project will contain

The primary component of the project will be a GUI where the player can interact with the inventory system. The GUI will contain storage space for the player to hold and manage items. The GUI will have a stat area that displays information about a selected item. A character panel will be included in the GUI that includes wearable storage slots for players to equip items that can be equipped, such as a hat, or pants. The GUI will contain icons representing items, that will be unique to each item. Items that can be grouped, will be stackable, that is, if you have 100 coins, they would take one grid space in the storage area, instead of 100 separate grid spaces.

On the back end, there will be a database containing item information. This information will be used in the GUI to display item information.
